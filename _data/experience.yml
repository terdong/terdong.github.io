    I taught Java Language and Android programming to students.
    
    Based on my experience teaching younger friend from college, I tried to make it as easy as possible for students to understand programming languages using blackboard, powerpoint, a kind of examples, and body language. As I taught others, I was also able to study and learn more, so I could take one step further as a developer.
